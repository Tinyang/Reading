Spring Boot Document

4. Getting Started
If you are getting started with Spring Boot, or Spring in general, start by reading this section. It answers the basic what? how? and why? questions. It includes and introduction to Spring Boot, along with installation instructions. We then walk you through building your first Spring Boot application, discussion some core principles as we go.

4.1. Introucing Spring Boot
Spring Boot helps you to create stand-along, production-grade Spring-based applications that you can run. We take an opinioned view of the Spring Platfrom and third-party libraries, so that you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

You can use Spring Boot to create Java applications that can be started by using java -jar or more traditional war deployments. We also provide a command line tool that runs "spring scripts".

Our primary goals are:
Provide a radically faster and widely accessible getting-started experience for all Spring development.
Be opinionated out of the box but get of the way quickly as requirements start to diverge from the defaults.
Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects(such as embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration)
Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuraion.

4.2. System Requirements
Spring Boot 2.5.3 requires Java8 and is compatible up to including Java16. Spring Framework 5.3.9 or above is also required.

Build Tool
Maven 3.5+
Gradle 6.8+
